#  Validation protocol for input catalogs

Summary -- A standard protocol should be developed to test the catalogs.

## Key Tasks
* Key Task CS4.2.1 ( 06/16 ): Develop the protocol needed to test input catalogs. E.g. how
should iteration be orchestrated, how should validation activities be captured?

### Suggested organization
Repositories are available per deliverable.  Each key task has a subdirectory.
We have a `source` directory in each key task area for any supporting
code that goes with an effort.  There will also be a `doc` directory to hold documents in markdown,
latex, or binary formats.  The idea is to version everything and give us a good way to diff things.

Each deliverable is slightly different, so these repositories should grow to support the different need.

Please feel free to use github issues on each repository to organize work.
